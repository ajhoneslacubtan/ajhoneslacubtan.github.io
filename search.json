    "text": "Data visualization is not just about making charts‚Äîit‚Äôs about shaping how people understand information. This portfolio features a diverse collection of visual storytelling techniques, from ridge plots and slope charts to KDE overlays, pictograms, and polar heatmaps. Each piece is crafted to reveal patterns, compare trends, or highlight part-to-whole relationships, using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, and thoughtful design enhancement. Whether it‚Äôs an abstract 2D density map or a clean part-to-whole breakdown, every visual here reflects my goal: to turn data into insight through clarity, structure, and creativity."

    "text": "Insights at a Glance\n\nRegional Income Inequality\n\n\n\nFilipino Household Income Per Region\n\n\nNCR and Central Luzon sit at the top of the income ladder while ARMM anchors the bottom, exposing wide regional gaps and large within-region spreads in richer areas.\n\n\n\nVaccination Gap\n\n\n\nPhilippine Vaccine Rollout Update\n\n\nOnly 15.5 % of Filipinos were fully vaccinated in mid-2021‚Äîfar below the 70 % herd-immunity goal‚Äîhighlighting how urgently the rollout needed to accelerate.\n\n\n\nWhat Drives Boston Home Prices?\n\n\n\nBoston House Prices Correlation Heatmap\n\n\nStrong TAX‚ÄìRAD (0.91) and DIS‚ÄìAGE (0.73) correlations flag multicollinearity risks, while the ‚àí0.74 link between PRICE and LSTAT marks socioeconomic status as a key price driver.\n\n\n\nSeasons in a Single Glance\n\n\n\nRidgeline Plot of Min and Max Temperatures\n\n\nRidgelines drift higher and broaden from April to May, turning a year of climate data into an intuitive seasonal fingerprint of Bukidnon‚Äôs warming cycle.\n\n\n\nFarming Winners and Laggards\n\n\n\nPhilippine Food and Agriculture Production Slope Chart\n\n\nRice‚Äôs steep climb dwarfs other staples, while coffee and beef stay flat‚Äîrevealing both the strength of grain production and untapped potential in specialty crops.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of an Athlete\n\n\n\nHeight‚ÄìWeight Scatter with KDE\n\n\nMale Olympians cluster around 170 cm/70 kg, females lower and lighter, with KDE ridges underscoring gender-specific ‚Äúathlete zones‚Äù that could guide talent scouting.\n\n\n\nThe Price of Ivory\n\n\n\nAfrican Bush Elephant Trade Bar Chart\n\n\nIvory carvings, tusks, and trophies dominate the trade‚Äîan unsettling visual reminder of how consumer demand threatens an iconic species.\n\n\n\nYouth Vote, Big Voice\n\n\n\nRegistered Voters by Age Group Pictogram\n\n\nMore than 53 % of registered voters are under 40, signaling a generational power shift that could reshape future Philippine elections.\n\n\n\nPathways to the Stars\n\n\n\nTop Astronaut Majors\n\n\nOne-third of astronauts studied Physics; Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering follow closely. STEM still reigns supreme on the road to space.\n\n\n\nRating Magical Worlds\n\n\n\nGenre Ratings for Magical Anime\n\n\nThriller and Psychological genres top the ratings, while Parody trails‚Äîshowing audiences favor darker, introspective magic over lighthearted fare.\n\n\n\nMultivariate Health Snapshot\n A single grid unveils how biomarkers cluster: healthy donors pack tightly around low ALT/AST, while hepatitis cases scatter higher on both axes. Diagonal histograms confirm dramatic right-skew in disease markers‚Äîclear signals for any diagnostic model.\n\n\n\nDensity, Reimagined\n\n\n\n2-D KDE Abstract\n\n\nAn abstract 2-D KDE turns raw coordinates into fluid contour rings‚Äîdemonstrating how a statistical surface can double as minimalist art without losing its sense of central tendency and spread.\n\n\n\nWind Meets Temperature\n\n\n\nPolar Heatmap of Wind vs Temperature\n\n\nThis polar heatmap maps wind direction against speed, with color encoding temperature. Warm reds concentrate in south-westerlies, while cooler teals hug north-eastern bands‚Äîlinking micro-climate breezes to swings in New York‚Äôs daily temps."

    "text": "Reflections and Next Steps\nCreating these visualizations has reinforced my belief that good data visualization is as much about storytelling as it is about clarity and accuracy. Each chart represents an intentional effort to simplify complexity and to highlight insights that might otherwise remain hidden. By experimenting across multiple visualization techniques and datasets, I‚Äôve deepened my skills in design thinking, statistical interpretation, and audience-focused communication.\n\nLet‚Äôs Talk Data Stories\nHave a dataset that deserves to be seen, not just analyzed?\nWhether you‚Äôre looking to visualize research findings, tell a story with public data, or enhance stakeholder reports, I‚Äôd love to help turn raw numbers into compelling visuals.\nFeel free to email me or explore more of my work on GitHub."
