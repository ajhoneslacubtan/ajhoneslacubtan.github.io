    "text": "Problem Statement\nCustomer churn refers to customers stopping their engagement with a company. To address this, we aim to build a Machine Learning model that predicts churn scores (ranging from 1 to 5) based on user demographics, browsing behavior, and purchase history. Accurate predictions will enable proactive retention strategies."
