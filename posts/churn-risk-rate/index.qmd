Customer retention is vital for business success, and high churn rates can significantly impact revenue. This project focuses on predicting customer churn scores to help an up-and-coming startup minimize churn and enhance customer loyalty.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn refers to customers stopping their engagement with a company. To address this, we aim to build a Machine Learning model that predicts churn scores (ranging from 1 to 5) based on user demographics, browsing behavior, and purchase history. Accurate predictions will enable proactive retention strategies.

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

-   **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc.
-   **PII Details**: Personally identifiable information.
-   **Membership Details**: Type, duration, status.
-   **Website Visits**: Frequency and duration.
-   **Grievances and Feedback**: Complaints and feedback records.

This dataset is sourced from the [HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: How NOT to lose a customer in 10 days](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/new/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-customer-churn/).

## Objective

Our goal is to analyze the data, build a predictive model for churn scores, and evaluate its performance to provide actionable insights for reducing customer churn.

## Machine Learning Workflow

We will follow a structured workflow:

1.  Data Retrieval
2.  Data Processing & Wrangling
3.  Feature Extraction & Engineering
4.  Feature Scaling & Selection
5.  Modeling
6.  Model Evaluation & Tuning
7.  Deployment & Monitoring

This iterative process ensures continuous improvement and model optimization.

This project is presented in three parts:

1.  **EDA + Feature Engineering**: Exploring and transforming data to create valuable features.
2.  **Modeling**: Building, evaluating, and tuning machine learning models.
3.  **Deployment**: Creating an API and a dashboard for model deployment and monitoring.

Stay tuned as we dive into data analysis, model development, and deployment to effectively tackle customer churn.
