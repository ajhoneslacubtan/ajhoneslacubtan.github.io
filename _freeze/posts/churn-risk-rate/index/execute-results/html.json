High customer churn rates can lead to significant revenue loss, making it imperative for companies to understand and predict customer churn to implement effective retention strategies. In this project, we focus on predicting the customer churn score for an up-and-coming startup, aiming to minimize churn and enhance customer loyalty.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCustomer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company over a given period. For businesses, understanding and reducing churn is essential for long-term sustainability. To tackle this, every user of the product or service is assigned a churn prediction score, which estimates their likelihood of leaving the company. This score ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating low churn risk and 5 indicating high churn risk.\n\nOur task is to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the churn score based on multiple factors, including the userâ€™s demographic details, browsing behavior, and historical purchase data. By accurately predicting these scores, the startup can proactively address issues leading to churn and implement targeted retention strategies.\n\n## Data Description\n\nThe dataset provided for this challenge contains various features that can influence customer churn. These features include: \n\n- **Demographic Details**: Information about the user's age, gender, location, etc. \n- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Details**: Information that can identify individual users. \n- **Membership Account Details**: Information about the user's membership type, duration, and status. \n- **Website Visit Details**: Duration and frequency of visits to the website. \n- **Reported Grievances and Feedback**: Records of any complaints or feedback provided by the user.\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to explore the factors influencing customer churn and build a predictive model.\n\n## Source of the Data\n\nThe dataset for this project is sourced from the \"HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: How NOT to lose a customer in 10 days.\" This challenge is designed to help participants enhance their Machine Learning skills by applying them to real-world problems. By participating in this challenge, we aim to build a model that successfully predicts the churn score of customers and contributes to the startup's efforts to reduce churn.\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of this project is to analyze the provided data, build a Machine Learning model to predict the churn score, and evaluate the model's performance. Through this process, we will gain insights into the factors contributing to customer churn and demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive model.\n\nStay tuned as we dive into the data, explore various modeling techniques, and strive to create an impactful solution to minimize customer churn.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1\n```\n:::\n",
